## Projects at 42
At 42, we don't progress from one year to another in the traditional sense. We don't have teachers. We learn through peer-to-peer learning, using projects similar to professional case specifications. For this reason, only a few projects can be validated with a score under 100%, and for many projects, we can receive up to 125% as a mark.

The Common Core is mandatory to complete and succeed in the initial training.

The Outer Circle (so named because of our "Holy Graph" which illustrate our training program) serves as a sort of bonus, enabling us to specialize and earn "RNCP" titles.

### 42 common core projects

Legend :
* "Old" : means I have done before a reorganization of the training program that happen during our training. It can involve big changes in the subject of a project.
* "Actual" : means it corresponds to our actual training program

### Outer Circle

#### For "RNCP" level 7 title "Expert in Computer Architecture" with a specialization in "Database and Data Architecture."
Here, we can specialize and earn an "RNCP" title by meeting certain conditions. I was aiming for an RNCP Level 7 title (equivalent to a Master's degree) called **"Expert in Computer Architecture"** with a specialization in **"Database and Data Architecture."**

I had three modules with different projects to complete:

* **Web - Database**
* **Artificial Intelligence**
* A third module called "Suite" in French (not sure why)
